I am an ethical hacker currently on my way to getting my OSCP and CompTIA A+... TRY HARDER!!!
While I'm aware I'm quite young for joining the field the way I am but that only encourages me to push further and harder!
I look for any way to learn things I love learning about technology!
I love learning why things are why they are!
